This project taught me how to manage branches, handle merge conflicts, and use pull requests effectively.  
I fixed mistakes like pushing to the wrong branch and forgetting to add files before committing.  
The `git merge` and `gh pr` commands saved the day by helping me resolve conflicts and merge cleanly.
